## Hypothesis
**pydocker-cli** was a personal project to:
* make lots of half-baked tiny python command line apps

---
## Project Structure
     pydocker-cli/                                <-- Root of your project

          |- actions.yml                          <-- GitHub actions file for app
          |- app.py                               <-- Tiny Python app
          |- Dockerfile                           <-- Dockerfile for app
          |- requirements.txt                     <-- Tiny Python app dependencies

## Methodology

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) to test the above hypothesis.

### Non-existant viable feature
* make lots of half-baked tiny python command line apps
* Moved from **main.yml** 'steps.working-directory' to **actions.yml** 'run.steps.working-directory' as it does not work in combination with **main.yml** 'steps.uses'

### Existing viable feature

* send email from Gmail using smtplib (Rade2020)
* continuous deployment of tiny python apps using GitHub Actions (Mezz2020)

---
## Complexity

Count the cost of complexity, i.e. incremental reward and risk reduction, before evolving MVP.

### Non-existant bloat
* Nil

### Existing bloat 
* Nil
