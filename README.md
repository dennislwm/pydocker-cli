## Hypothesis
**pydocker-cli** was a personal project to:
* make lots of half-baked tiny python command line apps

---
## Project Structure
     pydocker-cli/                                <-- Root of your project
       |- .gitignore                              <-- Git ignore file
       |- README.md                               <-- This README markdown file
       +- .github/                                <-- Root of GitHub templates, workflows, actions

          |- actions.yml                          <-- GitHub actions file
          |- app.py                               <-- Tiny Python app
          |- Dockerfile                           <-- Dockerfile for app
          |- requirements.txt                     <-- Tiny Python app dependencies
          |- udemyenrol.md                        <-- Daily Free Udemy Courses published by GitHub Actions

## Methodology

This is the minimum viable product (MVP) to test the above hypothesis.

### Non-existant viable feature
* make lots of half-baked tiny python command line apps
* enable Dockerfile WORKDIR support for GitHub Actions (see [Issue #4](#issue-4))

### Existing viable feature

* send email from Gmail using smtplib (Rade2020)
* continuous deployment of tiny python apps using GitHub Actions (Mezz2020)

---
## Complexity

Count the cost of complexity, i.e. incremental reward and risk reduction, before evolving MVP.

### Non-existant bloat
* Nil

### Existing bloat 
* Nil

### Issue #4
* This is a solution to enable Dockerfile WORKDIR support for GitHub Actions:
  * In **main.yml**, set both *steps.with.entrypoint* and *steps.with.args* values in combination with *steps.uses*, to overwrite ENTRYPOINT and CMD in your Dockerfile respectively
    * For example, set *steps.with.entrypoint* and *steps.with.args* to "python3" and "udemyenrol/app.py" respectively
  * Why? In **Dockerfile**, GitHub Actions (GA) sets its source folder to GITHUB_WORKSPACE, ie. **root** folder.
    * For example, when using commands COPY or ADD, it copies or adds from GITHUB_WORKSPACE instead of current folder (see structure below)
```
     GITHUB_WORKSPACE/                            <-- Root of your repository
       +- udemyenrol/                             <-- Current folder for Dockerfile
          |- Dockerfile                           <-- In Dockerfile, "COPY . ." copies from GITHUB_WORKSPACE instead of current folder
```
  * We tried THREE (3) workarounds that failed:
    * In  **Dockerfile**, Github Actions ignores WORKDIR command
    * In **main.yml**, *steps.working-directory* does not work in combination with *steps.uses*
    * In **actions.yml**, *run.steps.working-directory* does not work in combination with *runs.using*: docker
  * Avoid using two separate Dockerfiles, one for GitHub Actions and one for local development.
