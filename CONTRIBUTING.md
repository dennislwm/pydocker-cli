## How To Contribute?

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to play nice with others.

1. Fork the repo.

1. Clone the repo.

    ```    
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/pydocker-cli <your-directory-name>
    ```

1. Change to the repository directory on your computer:

    ```
    cd <your-directory-name>
    ```

1. Create & checkout into a new branch `<name-of-branch>` using

    ```
    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>
    ```

Now you make changes to the source code.

1. Next, add and commit the changes to your local repository.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit
    ```

We recommend that you append the issue number #x to your commit message title.

1. Push the changes your branch.

    ```
    git push origin <name-of-branch>
    ```

1. Submit a Pull Request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub, you'll see a "Compare and Pull Request" button. Click on that button and submit your PR.
